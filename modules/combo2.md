# Module: Advanced Exploitation

You have now learned many different security concepts in this course!
It's time to put them together and solve challenges requiring complex exploitation chains!

## Lectures

Being a "putting it together" module, all lectures of all previous modules are also critical.

## Practice

- Challenges: `toddler2`

The goal of the challenge sets in this module is to get the flag.
There are a number of difficulty levels, and each challenge combines concepts from multiple modules.
Each challenge will tell you the concepts that it combines, which should help get you on the right path.
If you exploit it, you can get it to read the flag and print it out to you.

If you are ready to tackle the challenges, go to [https://cse466.pwn.college](https://cse466.pwn.college)! **CHALLENGES COMING 11/25/2020**
