## Practice


Again, you will practice on a set of generated challenges.
There is a `/flag` file, and you get to choose one binary on which the SUID flag will be set.

Each program will misuse the heap in some way.
You can subvert the program functionality through this misuse.
If you are successful, you can use it to read the `/flag` file.
