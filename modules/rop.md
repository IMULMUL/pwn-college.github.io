## Practice


Again, you will practice on a set of generated challenges.
There is a `/flag` file, and you get to choose one binary on which the SUID flag will be set.

Each program takes user input on stdin and use that as a ropchain.
If your chain successfully runs, you can use it to read the `/flag` file.

If you are ready to tackle the challenges, go to [https://ctf.pwn.college](https://ctf.pwn.college)!
