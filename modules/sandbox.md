## Practice


Again, you will practice on a set of generated challenges.
There is a `/flag` file, and you get to choose one binary on which the SUID flag will be set.
The binaries that you are allowed to choose are all under the `/pwn` directory.

Each program will sandbox you to protect the flag.
If you can escape the sandbox, you can use read the `/flag` file.

If you are ready to tackle the challenges, go to [https://ctf.pwn.college](https://ctf.pwn.college)!
