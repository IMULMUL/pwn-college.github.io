# The Belted

The hacker ethos goes beyond the acquisition of a satisfactory grade in a college course.
A true hacker is never satisfied with the state of their knowledge.
They strive, or are irresistably driven towards, the achievement of absolute mastery of technical topics.

Below is a list of true hackers: those who stared at the yellow box, and rather than flinching, dove in.
